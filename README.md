## Hi There!

My name is Eduard, and I'm an iOS developer. I love learning and sharing results of my researches

* 🖌️ Currently I'm working on [Redrawee](https://github.com/EduardJelenski/Redrawee) project that is supposed to help you understand the patterns SwiftUI follows when decides to redraw views
* 📚 I'm in constant learning of iOS development world, for now I have Combine as a next technology to dive deeper in
* ⁉️ I have a [Telegram channel](t.me/jelenskiOS) where I occasionaly post some iOS-stuff I consider non-obvious
